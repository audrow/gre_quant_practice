I am studying for the GRE. It seems like speed is key on the quantitative section and that the best way to be fast is to be good at mental math. 

To get more practice at mental math, I built this simple command line program to ask me math questions with random numbers, to keep things interesting and challenging. 

The things that I am testing myself on include
- Simple multiplication (the product of two numbers below 21)
- Combinations
- Prime factorization

I have a few months before the GRE, so this is a work in progress.
